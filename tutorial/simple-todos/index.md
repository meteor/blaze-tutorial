description: Learn how to create a Simple Todos with Meteor and Blaze
---

In this tutorial we will build a simple to-do tasks app using [Blaze](https://www.blazejs.org/guide/introduction.html) with the Meteor platform.

Blaze is a powerful library for creating user interfaces by writing reactive HTML templates. Usually, templates are written in Spacebars, a variant of Handlebars designed to take advantage of Tracker, Meteorâ€™s reactivity system. These templates are compiled into JavaScript UI components that are rendered by the Blaze library.

To develop your app, you will need a code editor. If you don't have any editor of your choice, a great option is to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After installing it, you can and the [Meteor Toolbox extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meteor-toolbox.meteor-toolbox) to enable intellisense for Meteor core and packages. This extension also adds launch configurations for the browser (run/debug).

Meteor works out-of-the-box with several other frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Vue](https://guide.meteor.com/vue.html). We recommend you check out all of our [tutorials](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials).

Let's get started with building your Blaze To-Do app with Meteor!
